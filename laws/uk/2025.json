The updates also streamline the process—legal aid providers no longer need to send certain notifications to themselves (like confirming they've issued legal aid), and decisions about eligibility or withdrawing services have been simplified. For ongoing cases, any unpaid contributions will be waived when these rules take effect, though people can't game the system by reapplying for the same legal issue just to avoid past fees.

The changes follow public consultation and apply to things like registering devices, approving testing bodies, and clinical trial oversight. Small companies get more time to pay some fees. There's also a new optional service—paid regulatory advice—replacing an old fee. Updates for Northern Ireland mirror these changes. The full cost breakdown is available online.",

    "summary": "These rules explain what online service providers must give Ofcom (the UK’s communications regulator) when reporting certain details under the Online Safety Act 2023. This helps Ofcom work out what fees the provider needs to pay. The rules specify what proof or documents must be sent, how to send them—referencing Ofcom’s published guidelines—and note that no separate business cost assessment was done because it relates to fees. Ofcom did, however, assess the rules’ impact during public consultations, with updates in their final policy statement. More details are available on their website.",

    "link": "http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/uksi/2025/746",
    "summary": "This update tweaks the rules around local government referendums and elected mayors in England. If enough people petition to change how their council is run between July 2025 and the next election day in 2026, the vote must happen within six months after that election. If they choose to switch to a mayoral system, the first mayor election will happen at the second regular election after the decision. The same timing applies if councils skip a referendum and directly choose a mayoral system. These changes smooth out the process without making things harder - it's just adjusting dates to keep everything running smoothly around election times.",

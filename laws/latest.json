    "summary": "This law removes a licensing requirement for Riverside Energy Park Limited's Belvedere energy-from-waste facility, allowing it to generate electricity without restriction. By permanently exempting the site from needing an electricity supply license, the change streamlines operations for the company, which aims to convert waste into renewable energy. This could boost local renewable energy availability, reduce landfill reliance, and advance circular economy efforts in London, though regulators emphasize no major sector-wide impacts are expected. The move reflects targeted support for specific waste-to-energy projects under strict oversight.",

It streamlines parish governance by mandating training for newly elected church council members and clarifying election processes when candidates match available seats. The changes align financial reporting with Charity Commission standards, enhance accountability by expanding trustee disqualification criteria, and ensure local councils receive updated governance guidelines. These adjustments aim to modernize church administration, improve transparency, and reduce bureaucratic hurdles in parish decision-making.",

It officially allows \"hub and spoke\" systems where local pharmacies or doctors (\"spokes\") send prescriptions to a central pharmacy (\"hub\") for processing, then receive the medicines back for final patient supply. Community pharmacies must now tell NHS England before setting up these arrangements and follow strict rules on how they operate. NHS England can block unsafe or poorly run hub systems. The law also removes outdated paperwork requirements like mandatory practice leaflets and staff reference checks, freeing up pharmacist time. It ensures HPV vaccines remain freely available to pharmacies under NHS supply deals and updates digital systems (replacing NHSmail with NHSnet.Connect). Crucially, this secures access to medicines in remote villages by making shared pharmacy services legal and safe, while giving NHS England direct oversight to prevent poor-quality outsourcing that could risk patient safety.",

Previously, even if someone qualified for universal credit, their habitual residence status (in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, or Republic of Ireland) had to be re-evaluated for housing benefit eligibility. Now, if they’re already on universal credit, the residency decision is treated as settled, allowing them to access housing benefit faster without repeating the process.

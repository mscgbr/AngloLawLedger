The change allows solar power stations to operate at up to 100 megawatts without needing this specific consent.

It replaces the previous borrowing limit increase from early 2024, which is now cancelled. No major impacts on public services or charities are expected, so no detailed assessment was needed.",

They also tweak the list of official trade agreements to include this new arrangement. The government says there’s no need for a full assessment of the changes because they won’t really affect businesses or the public—most of this just keeps existing rules in place, and the broader impacts were already covered in a 2021 report.",

It updates cargo codes, removes outdated ones, and revises rules about certain imports – like adding a banana trade quota for Colombia and extra duties on urea from Russia and Belarus. It also scraps some old Ukraine and Moldova-related customs rules that aren’t needed anymore. Most changes are technical, so there’s no major impact expected for businesses or the public.",

    "summary": "This update changes several legal aid rules to simplify the process and remove fees. It scraps the requirement for people to pay contributions for civil legal aid and eases administrative burdens—like no longer forcing providers to send unnecessary paperwork to themselves. Changes also cover criminal legal aid, like backdating eligibility in some cases and removing duplicate financial checks for Crown Court cases after a magistrates’ court decision. Existing cases will generally follow the new rules, waiving unpaid contributions, but people can’t reapply just to dodge old fees. Some new rules apply retroactively to May 2025. The government says these tweaks won’t significantly impact public sector costs.",

The changes follow public consultation and apply to things like registering devices, approving testing bodies, and clinical trial oversight. Small companies get more time to pay some fees. There's also a new optional service—paid regulatory advice—replacing an old fee. Updates for Northern Ireland mirror these changes. The full cost breakdown is available online.",

    "summary": "These rules explain what online service providers must give Ofcom (the UK’s communications regulator) when reporting certain details under the Online Safety Act 2023. This helps Ofcom work out what fees the provider needs to pay. The rules specify what proof or documents must be sent, how to send them—referencing Ofcom’s published guidelines—and note that no separate business cost assessment was done because it relates to fees. Ofcom did, however, assess the rules’ impact during public consultations, with updates in their final policy statement. More details are available on their website.",

    "summary": "This update tweaks the rules around local government referendums and elected mayors in England. If enough people petition to change how their council is run between July 2025 and the next election day in 2026, the vote must happen within six months after that election. If they choose to switch to a mayoral system, the first mayor election will happen at the second regular election after the decision. The same timing applies if councils skip a referendum and directly choose a mayoral system. These changes smooth out the process without making things harder - it's just adjusting dates to keep everything running smoothly around election times.",

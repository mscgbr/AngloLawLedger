    "summary": "The 2025 regulations introduce a streamlined process for charities to make small payments driven by moral obligations—without needing prior approval from regulators or courts—as long as they meet clear legal tests. From November 2025, charity trustees can approve these payments directly, with the maximum amount tied to the charity’s annual income (making larger charities more flexible). A separate change clarifies that decisions on such payments can be handled by others, not just trustees, though trustees remain accountable. Museums and galleries remain barred from removing certain collection items, preserving existing safeguards. These changes aim to reduce bureaucracy while ensuring responsible financial use, potentially speeding up support for vulnerable individuals or public services in urgent need.",

Previously, only nuclear power plants were covered under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The updated regime now includes disposal sites, holding their operators strictly liable (up to a legal cap) for accidents and requiring them to secure approved funds. However, if a site meets four specific safety conditions—like operating under strict permits, having a safe history, posing low radiation risks, and avoiding criticality hazards—it can be classified as an \"excluded disposal site,\" removing its liability under the regime. This ensures operators of other nuclear facilities (e.g., power plants) aren’t held responsible for waste disposed of at such exempt sites. The change aligns the UK with international nuclear safety standards while reducing compliance costs for qualifying low-risk disposal sites.",

    "summary": "This law changes how rural pharmacies and doctor-led dispensing services can outsource medicine preparation. It officially allows \"hub and spoke\" systems where local pharmacies or doctors (\"spokes\") send prescriptions to a central pharmacy (\"hub\") for processing, then receive the medicines back for final patient supply. Community pharmacies must now tell NHS England before setting up these arrangements and follow strict rules on how they operate. NHS England can block unsafe or poorly run hub systems. The law also removes outdated paperwork requirements like mandatory practice leaflets and staff reference checks, freeing up pharmacist time. It ensures HPV vaccines remain freely available to pharmacies under NHS supply deals and updates digital systems (replacing NHSmail with NHSnet.Connect). Crucially, this secures access to medicines in remote villages by making shared pharmacy services legal and safe, while giving NHS England direct oversight to prevent poor-quality outsourcing that could risk patient safety.",

    "summary": "These changes simplify housing benefit applications for people already receiving universal credit by removing redundant residency checks. Previously, even if someone qualified for universal credit, their habitual residence status (in the UK, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, or Republic of Ireland) had to be re-evaluated for housing benefit eligibility. Now, if they’re already on universal credit, the residency decision is treated as settled, allowing them to access housing benefit faster without repeating the process. This streamlines support for vulnerable individuals and reduces administrative burden on both applicants and local authorities.",

This means competitors cannot legally use that data to copy and sell similar products before 2030, protecting the original developer's investment while regulators complete safety reviews for certain substances.

Previously, only nuclear power plants were covered under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The updated regime now includes disposal sites, holding their operators strictly liable (up to a legal cap) for accidents and requiring them to secure approved funds. However, if a site meets four specific safety conditions—like operating under strict permits, having a safe history, posing low radiation risks, and avoiding criticality hazards—it can be classified as an \"excluded disposal site,\" removing its liability under the regime. This ensures operators of other nuclear facilities (e.g., power plants) aren’t held responsible for waste disposed of at such exempt sites. The change aligns the UK with international nuclear safety standards while reducing compliance costs for qualifying low-risk disposal sites.",

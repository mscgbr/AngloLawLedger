    "summary": "This law changes how businesses are taxed when HMRC pays them interest after wrongly collecting too much tax. Previously, businesses faced a punitive 45% tax on even small interest refunds. Now, they keep the full amount if the interest rate matches or falls below the government’s standard rate (currently 3.5%), meaning businesses receive larger refunds for HMRC errors. It also gives HMRC up to two years after a business’s financial year ends to collect the tax on higher-interest refunds, preventing missed deadlines during lengthy court disputes or settlements.",

OFCOM can dismiss complaints if they lack necessary info or repeat prior issues. The process aims to ensure only credible, well-prepared concerns get reviewed, streamlining oversight of online safety without overburdening regulators.

The tweak follows a push to modernize how airspace is designed, allowing the government to task NATS with proposing improvements (such as more efficient flight paths) and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to approve them. While the reform is procedural, it could lead to smoother airspace management over time, potentially benefiting airlines, airports, and travelers through reduced delays or operational costs. However, officials say the immediate economic impact will be small, with annual costs for businesses staying under £10 million, so no detailed analysis was required.",

The change ensures companies investing in cleaner energy tech aren’t stuck in old deals, but they’ll need to plan ahead: terminations only take effect years later to avoid disrupting the power supply. It also sets out how providers can appeal if their switch gets rejected and clarifies financial protections like releasing held deposits. Designed to smooth transitions into carbon capture initiatives, this tweak aims to support greener energy projects while keeping the grid stable, likely speeding up the UK’s shift away from polluting power sources with minimal disruption to businesses already in the system.",

Previously, strict limits on sharing this information made it harder to spot mistakes or fraud in payments for support like home care, nursing homes, or disability assistance. By scrapping these rules, councils can now cross-check data—such as who’s receiving care and what they’re being charged—to recover misused funds, fix billing errors, and ensure services are run fairly. The change aims to cut costs for local authorities by reducing losses from fraudulent claims or administrative slip-ups and streamline processes by removing outdated paperwork hurdles. Any money saved could free up resources for councils to reinvest in social care improvements or other community needs, while stronger data collaboration might lead to quicker identification of ineligible claims or service gaps in vulnerable populations.",

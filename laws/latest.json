It lets ministers impose conditions—like requiring stricter oversight—or withdraw approval if standards slip, so deals with places like the EU, US or Singapore can happen faster while protecting UK markets.

    "summary": "These regulations create \"special tax sites\" in the UK where companies investing in machinery, equipment, or non-residential buildings (like factories or warehouses) can claim bigger tax breaks. This means businesses in these zones can deduct more from their taxable profits when spending on infrastructure, aiming to spur investment, job creation, and regional economic growth. Enhanced allowances take effect immediately, aligning with the Spring Budget 2023, and prioritize areas targeted for development.",

    "summary": "These rules create \"special tax sites\" (like freeports) with enhanced tax breaks for businesses investing in machinery, buildings, or infrastructure there. Companies can deduct a larger portion of their costs from taxable income when they spend money in these areas, directly reducing their tax bills. This incentivizes investment, potentially boosting local job creation, business growth, and development in targeted zones by making such projects financially more attractive.",

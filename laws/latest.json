    "summary": "These changes bring Ministry of Defence Police discipline rules in line with recent reforms for regular police forces. Officers found guilty of gross misconduct – including automatic classification for serious criminal convictions – will now face mandatory dismissal unless extremely rare exceptions apply, removing previous discretion. The process speeds up too: disciplinary notices can be sent by email instead of post (with clear rules on when they count as received), and performance reviews are simplified from a three-step to a two-step system, requiring officers to prove improvement within three months. Former officers will typically face faster-track misconduct hearings unless they opt out. Overall, this tightens accountability, accelerates removal of unfit officers, and modernises procedures for staff and oversight bodies.",

    "summary": "These changes bring Ministry of Defence Police discipline rules in line with recent reforms for regular police forces. Officers found guilty of gross misconduct – including automatic classification for serious criminal convictions – will now face mandatory dismissal unless extremely rare exceptions apply, removing previous discretion. The process speeds up too: disciplinary notices can be sent by email instead of post (with clear rules on when they count as received), and performance reviews are simplified from a three-step to a two-step system, requiring officers to prove improvement within three months. Former officers will typically face faster-track misconduct hearings unless they opt out. Overall, this tightens accountability, accelerates removal of unfit officers, and modernises procedures for staff and oversight bodies.",

Now, they keep the full amount if the interest rate matches or falls below the government’s standard rate (currently 3.5%), meaning businesses receive larger refunds for HMRC errors. It also gives HMRC up to two years after a business’s financial year ends to collect the tax on higher-interest refunds, preventing missed deadlines during lengthy court disputes or settlements.",

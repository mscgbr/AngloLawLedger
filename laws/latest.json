    "summary": "This law ends several legacy benefits starting in late 2025 to push all working-age people onto Universal Credit. By 1 December 2025, anyone receiving Employment and Support Allowance solely based on past National Insurance contributions (not income) loses their right to future income-related top-ups and is switched to the new-style allowance. From 1 April 2026, Income Support and Income-Based Jobseeker’s Allowance stop completely except for short transition periods—claimants must switch to Universal Credit by that date or lose payments. It also cuts off Housing Benefit for working-age people moving out of temporary or supported housing into regular accommodation after 14 November 2025, forcing them onto Universal Credit’s housing element instead. Missing these deadlines means immediate loss of support.",

    "summary": "Diabetic bus and lorry drivers can now use any modern glucose monitor—including continuous sensors—instead of being forced to do finger-prick blood tests while driving. This change cuts dangerous distractions by letting drivers track their blood sugar safely on the road, reducing unnecessary stops and keeping them focused. Drivers no longer risk losing their licence just for using newer, more convenient monitoring tech approved by their doctor.",
